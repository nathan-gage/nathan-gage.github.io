everyone is overdosing melatonin.

the [ideal dose]("https://gwern.net/melatonin#tempus-fugit") is 0.3 ~ 1.0mg; the most popular doses are 10mg+.

and yet, everyone should probably be taking melatonin.

**melatonin is not a make-me-tired aid. melatonin is for making bad sleep worthwhile.**

don't take it to get sleepy. take it to establish good sleep hygiene.

melatonin allows you to get "7 hours" of sleep in 6 hours. [it will help your hormones greatly]("https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4377487/">).

i recommend [herbatonin 0.3mg](https://www.amazon.com/Herbatonin-0-3mg-Phyto-Melatonin-Melatonin-Circadian/dp/B006H9T94Q).
