Nobody ever told me the importance of fresh air. I mean, they did, but I didn't listen. 

\
[CO2 makes you dumb](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510037).


\
In _every_ room I've been in (even with active fresh air in the HVAC system), the CO₂ reaches 800-900+ ppm.

In my apartment, it averages around 1200-1300 ppm.

\
Why is that bad?

\
[From the article](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510037):
> We found statistically significant declines in cognitive function scores when CO2 concentrations were increased to levels that are common in indoor spaces (approximately 950 ppm). In fact, this level of CO2 is considered acceptable because it would satisfy ASHRAE’s ventilation rate guidance for acceptable indoor air quality. Larger differences were seen when CO2 was raised to 1,400 ppm.

\
CO₂ concentration is measured in parts-per-million (ppm). Look at the concentration (x-axis) and see the **Crisis Response**, **Information Usage**, and **Strategy** charts.

\
High CO₂ concentration is poison for your brain. **You are less effective the more CO₂ in your environment**. 

\
For months, I experienced malaise in my apartment. I could not work, could not motivate, could not think. Turns out, I was drowning in my own breath. I have not closed my windows in months now. 

# other important notes 

CO₂ concentration also increases as people/animals do. At family gatherings, our home, normally 600-800ppm, reaches 1100+ ppm.

## old homes vs. new homes
In 1920s New York, radiators were designed to heat homes, even with the windows open. This was in order to ward off the Spanish Flu. This was dubbed the [Fresh Air Movement](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/realestate/radiators-steam-heat-temperature-control.html). 

\
This standard remains today, meaning NYC renters/owners commonly complain that radiators get *too hot*, since most users aren't leaving their windows open in the winter. 

\
Modern homes are not necessarily designed with this in mind, but you'll be surprised how effectively A/C or Heating is against open air entering the home via window. My apartment electricity bill went up only 7% on average. I only close my windows in the summer, during the hottest hours, but otherwise they remain open. Ironically, the older the apartment/home is, the more likely it was designed with fresh air in mind. 

# how to monitor CO₂ 
I have the older [Temtop P1000 CO₂ Monitor](https://www.airdetectortools.com/products/temtop-p1000-co2-air-quality-monitor-pm2-5-pm10-tabletop). 

\
Though, they have newer, cheaper offerings. Don't waste money on anything >$100. Mine was $60 during Black Friday.
